"Jenny Lee, that's me!"

My journey into the tech world began with a career change. I initially worked as a Physician Assistant, committed to delivering equity in an evolving healthcare system. During this time, I witnessed firsthand the incredible impact of innovative software and devices: from saving lives to improving patient care.

This ignited a passionate belief in me that technology offered the ideal platform for me to create a positive impact, driven by my insatiable curiosity to understand the inner workings of things and find ways to enhance efficiency. I decided to pivot my career, combining my newfound passion for tech with my skills. I embarked on a path to create solutions that not only address complex problems but also have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, and so, my journey in the tech-driven world began!

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring and hiking in remote areas: gaining new insights and inspiration from the beauty of nature.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Python, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Flask, Express
